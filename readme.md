# DECATHLON TABLE TEST
Made two variants "dec_test.py" using python, "dec_pandas.py" using pandas.


Made NO virtual environment so ensure you have pandas installed before running "dec_pandas.py".


Both modules take initial CSV file name as the first command line parameter:

  * dec_test.py dec.csv 

  * dec_pandas.py dec.csv
